title: About me
---

My name is Hee Choi, and I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at Penn State University. You might know me as a geodynamicist interested in early Earth, mantle convection, and machine learning. If you are interested in the scientist version of me, my CV can be found [here](assets/data/hchoi_cv_ac.pdf). You can also take a look at my [Research page](https://heec12.github.io/research/).

But I also have the following qualities:
- I can make a great cup of coffee
- I'm a helicopter mom to my puppy, [Hodu](https://www.instagram.com/hoduthepuppy)
- I enjoy camping and spending time in nature
- Baking is my kind of therapy

What else do you need?
