My name is Hee Choi, and I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at Penn State University. You might know me as a geodynamicist interested in early Earth, mantle convection, and machine learning. If you’re here for the academic side of things, feel free to check out my [CV](assets/data/hchoi_cv_ac.pdf) or head over to the [Research page](https://heec12.github.io/research/).

But beyond the science, I’m also someone who:
- Can make a great cup of coffee
- Is a very dedicated (read: helicopter) dog mom to my puppy, [Hodu](https://www.instagram.com/hoduthepuppy)
- Finds peace in camping and quiet time outdoors
- Uses baking as my kind of therapy

What else do you need?
