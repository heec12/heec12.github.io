My name is Hee Choi, and I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at Georgia Tech.  
You might know me as a geodynamicist interested in early Earth, mantle convection, and machine learning.  
If you’re here for the academic side of things, [CV](assets/data/hchoi_cv_2.pdf) or head over to the [Research page](/research/).

But beyond the science, I’m also someone who:

- Can make a great cup of coffee  
- Is a very dedicated (read: helicopter) dog mom to my puppy, [Hodu](https://www.instagram.com/hoduthepuppy)  
- Finds peace in camping and quiet time outdoors  
- Uses baking as my kind of therapy
