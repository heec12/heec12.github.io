My name is Hee Choi. You might know me as a geodynamicist interested in early Earth, mantle convection, and machine learning. If you are interested in the scientist version of me, my CV can be found [here](assets/data/hchoi_cv_ac.pdf). You can also take a look at my Research page.

But I also have the following qualities:

- I can make a great cup of coffee
- I'm a helicopter mom to my puppy, [Hodu](https://www.instagram.com/hoduthepuppy)
- I'm always down for a good camping trip

What else do you need?
