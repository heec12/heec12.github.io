My name is Hee Choi, and I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at Penn State University. 
You might know me as a geodynamicist interested in early Earth, mantle convection, and machine learning. 
If you’re here for the academic side of things, <a href="assets/data/hchoi_cv_ac.pdf">CV</a> or head over to the <a href="https://heec12.github.io/research/">Research page</a>.

<br>
But beyond the science, I’m also someone who: <br>
- Can make a great cup of coffee<br>
- Is a very dedicated (read: helicopter) dog mom to my puppy, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hoduthepuppy">Hodu</a><br>
- Finds peace in camping and quiet time outdoors<br>
- Uses baking as my kind of therapy<br>
